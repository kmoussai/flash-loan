# 🧭 Global Project Rules — Next.js + Supabase

## Core Principles
- Always prioritize **code readability** and **maintainability**.  
- Use **clear naming conventions**, **consistent formatting**, and **meaningful comments**.  
- Write **modular, reusable code** — each component or function should have a **single responsibility**.  
- **Avoid repetition** — extract shared logic into utilities, hooks, or reusable components.  

## File Structure Guidelines
- Organize code logically:
  - `/components` → UI components  
  - `/hooks` → custom React hooks  
  - `/lib` → helper functions (e.g., Supabase client, validators)  
  - `/app/api` → Next.js API routes  
  - `/types` → shared TypeScript types  
  - `/utils` → pure helper functions  
- Create **separate files** for reusable code to keep builds optimized and reduce bundle size.  
- Use **lazy loading** or **dynamic imports** for large components when appropriate.  

## Supabase Integration
- Use **Supabase client** initialized in a shared module (`/lib/supabaseClient.ts`).  
- Handle **Auth** securely using Supabase’s Next.js integration (`@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`).  
- Always include **error handling** and **type safety** for DB operations.  
- Store and fetch files from **Supabase Storage** through a centralized helper (e.g., `/lib/storage.ts`).  

## Coding Standards
- Use **TypeScript** everywhere.  
- Keep functions and components **small, typed, and self-contained**.  
- Use **async/await** with proper try/catch error handling.  
- Include **docstrings** or inline comments for complex logic.  
- Follow **Next.js conventions** for file-based routing and server components.  
- Ensure code follows **ESLint + Prettier** formatting rules.  

## Performance & Optimization
- Use **React Server Components** and **API Routes** efficiently.  
- Implement **incremental static regeneration (ISR)** where possible.  
- Optimize Supabase queries — fetch only needed fields.  
- Apply **code splitting**, **memoization**, and **debouncing** where necessary.

## Prompt Behavior
Whenever generating or modifying code:
- Apply the above conventions automatically.
- Suggest reusable components or hooks instead of inline logic.
- Propose file structures and imports explicitly.
